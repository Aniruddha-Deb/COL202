\question Let $n$ be a positive integer. You are given a set of $n+1$ distinct
positive integers, each of which is less than or equal to $2n$. Use mathematical
induction to show that there is at least one integer in this set that divides 
another integer in this set.
\begin{solution}
\underline{Lemma:} If there are $n-1$ integers ($n \ge 3$) in $3$ and $2n-2$ inclusive, then
either two of them divide each other, or there exists a number that divides 
either $2n-1$ or $2n$.

\underline{Proof:} Proceed by Induction. 

\underline{Base Case:} $n=3$. Then, we are given $3$ and $4$, and $3$ divides $6$.
The base case holds.

\underline{Inductive step:} given $n$ integers in $3$ and $2n$ inclusive, 

Proceed by Induction:

\underline{Base Case:} $n=1$. We're then given two integers, $1$ and $2$. Since
$1$ divides $2$, the claim holds.

\underline{Induction hypothesis:} Claim that if $n-1$ is a positive integer and 
we are given $n$ distinct positive integers, each less than or equal to $2n-2$,
then there is at least one integer in this set that divides another integer in 
this set.

\underline{Inductive step:} given $n+1$ distinct positive integers, each less
than or equal to $2n$. Suppose the set of integers we are given is $S$. Two cases arise:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $2n \text{and} 2n-1 \in S$: There are $n-1$ distinct positive integers
	less than or equal to $2n-2$. Call this set $S'$. Assume that no two numbers 
	in $S'$ divide each other, and $1,2 \not \in S'$. Therefore, $\forall s \in S', 
	3 \le s \le 2n-2$. By pigeonhole principle, there exists at least even number
	or odd number in $S'$. 
	\item $2n \text{and} 2n-1 \not \in S$: There are $n$ distinct positive integers that 
	are less than or equal to $2n-2$, hence, by induction hypothesis, the claim
	is true.
\end{itemize}
\end{solution}
